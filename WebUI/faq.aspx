                    <h2>Which plan is right for me?</h2>
                    The price plan is based around how many projects you are likely to use in a month. Choose a plan that you think reflects how many projects you will take on each month. You can always increase or decrease your monthly allowance if your needs change.

                    <h2>How much access can I give others?</h2>
                    By inviting a contact, be they a staff member, a contractor or a client into your project you allow them access to everything that you can see. This means that communication between all parties becomes much easier. If one member needs access to project information they can simply log in rather than wasting time calling around.

                    <h2>Is my account safe?</h2>
                    Your account, which will contain private information such as client's contact details and job information, is completely secure. It can be accessed only by those whom you invite. Your invites are for single projects rather than your whole account so your data will be seen only by those you want to see it.<br />
