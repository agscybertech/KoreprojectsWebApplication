                    <br />
                    Our research showed that numerous small to medium sized businesses were interested in what project management software could do for them, but that many were put off when they found most programs to be too complicated for their needs. Kore Projects is the project management software with the solution to this problem.<br />
                    <br />
                    We asked our clients exactly what they would require from project management software. The results were simple: Greater organazation, clearer communication and centralized data. We took these ideas and incorporated them into a program that makes project management simple, offering all the benefits of other, similar systems without the unneccessary or confusing features.<br />
                    <br />
                    Kore Projects has been heaped with praise by every business that has taken it on. We've helped numerous companies become more organized and get the most out of  their working week. We'd love to do the same for you.<br />
