                    <p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This is the privacy notice of Arctic Swan Ltd t/a Kore Projects. In this document, &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; refers to Kore Projects<br />
                        <br />
                        This is a notice to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.<br />
                        <br />
                        We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with New Zealand law. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.<br />
                        <br />
                        We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our web site immediately.<br />
                        <br />
                        Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.<br />
                        <br />
                        Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our web site or because you give it to us in some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:<br />
                        <br />
                        1.    Basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details.<br />
                        This information is used:<br />
                        1.1.        to provide you with the services which you request;<br />
                        1.2.        for verifying your identity for security purposes;<br />
                        1.3.        for marketing our services and products;<br />
                        1.4.        Information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.<br />
                        <br />
                        2.    Market place information<br />
                        When we obtain information from you specifically to enable you to buy a service offered on our web site by some other person, we assume that in giving us your information, you are also giving us permission to pass it to the relevant person.<br />
                        <br />
                        3.    Your domain name and e-mail address are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not under any circumstances divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know, either generally or specifically. This information is used:<br />
                        <br />
                        3.1.        to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect.<br />
                        3.2.        in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;<br />
                        3.3.        to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;<br />
                        3.4.        to tell you about other of our services or services of sister web sites.<br />
                        <br />
                        4.    Information you post on our website<br />
                        Information you send to us by posting to a forum or blog or in your advertisement is stored on our servers. We do not specifically use that information except to allow it to be read, but you will see in our terms and conditions that we reserve a right to use it in any way we decide.<br />
                        <br />
                        5.    Website usage information<br />
                        We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect  information about which pages you view and how you reach them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you.<br />
                        <br />
                        6.    Financial information relating only to your credit cards<br />
                        This information is never taken by us either through our website or otherwise. At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of DPS Payment Express or some other reputable payment service provider. That page may be dressed in our &ldquo;livery&rdquo;, but it is not controlled by us. Our staff and contractors never have access to it.<br />
                        <br />
                        7.    Note on padlock symbols and other trust marks<br />
                        Many companies offer certification and an icon or other small graphic to prove to site visitors that the site is safe. Some certify to a high level of safety. Others are more concerned to take our money than to provide a useful service. We do not handle information about your credit card so do not subscribe to any such service. However, we suggest you assess this notice to judge that we do take your privacy seriously.<br />
                        <br />
                        8.    Financial information about your direct debit or your credit cards<br />
                        When you have agreed to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you have given to us is passed to our own bank BNZ for processing according to our instructions. We do / do not keep a copy.<br />
                        <br />
                        We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme.  (This provides for the customer&rsquo;s bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved "originators" of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.)<br />
                        <br />
                        9.    Our payment service provider retains you credit card information securely<br />
                        Your financial information is kept to provide you with a better you a better service and to prevent fraud.<br />
                        <br />
                        Our provider uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify their identity to your browser, and to encrypt any data you give them when you purchase, including financial information such as credit or debit card numbers. Our SSL certificate encryption level is 128-bit. Whenever you are asked for financial information, you can check that SSL is being used by looking for a closed padlock symbol or other trust mark in your browser URL bar or toolbar.<br />
                        <br />
                        10.Credit reference<br />
                        To assist in combating fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies so far as it relates to clients or customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.<br />
                        <br />
                        11.Business and personal information<br />
                        This includes all information given to us in the course of your business and ours, such as information you give us in your capacity as our client. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. It is not used for any other purpose. We expect you to reciprocate this policy.<br />
                        <br />
                        We keep information which forms part of our business record for minimum of 7 years. That is because we may need it in some way to support a claim or defence in court. That is also the period within which our tax collecting authorities may demand to know it.<br />
                        <br />
                        12.Third party advertising<br />

They may also use other technology such as cookies or JavaScript to personalise the content of, and to measure the performance of their adverts. We do not have control over these technologies or the data that these parties obtain. Accordingly, this privacy notice does not cover the information practices of these third parties.<br />
